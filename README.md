A centralized repository of design tokens for LG Electronics' UI Kit.

## Overview

This repository contains design tokens that define visual attributes for LG applications, specifically for the LG UI Kit design system. Design tokens help maintain consistency and enable theming across the ecosystem.

### What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are essential building blocks that define the visual attributes of a project. They include colors, typography, spacing, and more. By using design tokens, you can ensure consistency and maintainability across your UI.

### Token Hierarchy

Our design tokens are organized in a three-level hierarchy:

![Token Hierarchy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdb0a867-b0fa-43a9-8102-fecb0b6093a3)

1. **Component Tokens** (Top Layer)
   - Purpose: Define component-specific design properties
   - Example: `header-label-sub-color`
   - Always reference semantic tokens, never primitive tokens directly
   - Located in component-specific packages

2. **Semantic Tokens** (Middle Layer)
   - Purpose: Provide context-aware design values
   - Example: `on-background-sub`
   - Reference primitive tokens to maintain consistency
   - Located in `webos-tokens` package

3. **Primitive Tokens** (Bottom Layer)
   - Purpose: Define raw design values
   - Example: `neutral-gray-70` with value `#b3b3b3`
   - Contain actual CSS values (hex colors, pixel values, etc.)
   - Located in `core-tokens` package

### Monorepo Structure

This repository is structured as a monorepo, containing multiple packages:

* **core-tokens**: Provides the foundational, primitive design tokens used across all Enovaui projects. These tokens define the raw values for colors, typography, spacing, and other visual attributes.
* **webos-tokens**: Contains semantic design tokens specific to the webOS platform. These tokens map the primitive tokens to specific use cases within the platform's applications, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

### How to Use

Documentation and developer samples are coming soon. In the meantime, you can:

1. Browse through the token definitions in each package
2. Explore the JSON and CSS implementations
3. Check out our Figma design system for visual reference
4. Use the tokens in your projects by importing them from the respective packages
