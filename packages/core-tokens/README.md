# @enovaui/core-tokens

Core design tokens package for the LG UI Kit design system.

## Overview

This package provides the foundational, primitive design tokens used across the `enovaui` ecosystem. These tokens serve as the building blocks for all visual attributes in the LG UI Kit.

### What are Primitive Tokens?

Primitive tokens represent the most basic visual values in our design system:

* **Colors**: Base color palette
* **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and line heights
* **Spacing**: Standard spacing and layout measurements
* **Radius**: Border radius values for consistent component shapes

## Installation

To install the package, use your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @enovaui/core-tokens
```

or

```bash
yarn add @enovaui/core-tokens
```

### Token Structure

The tokens are organized in the following categories:

* `color-primitive`: Base color values
* `typography-primitive`: Typography-related values
* `spacing-primitive`: Spacing and sizing values
* `radius-primitive`: Border radius values
