# @enovaui/webos-tokens

Semantic design tokens for webOS applications in the LG UI Kit design system.

## Overview

This package contains semantic design tokens specifically crafted for webOS applications. These tokens map primitive values from `@enovaui/core-tokens` to meaningful, context-specific design properties.

### What are Semantic Tokens?

Semantic tokens translate primitive values into purpose-driven design tokens. They provide:

* **Meaningful Names**: Tokens are named by their purpose (e.g., `on-background-main`) rather than their value
* **Context-Aware Values**: Values are appropriate for specific UI contexts in webOS
* **Consistent Theming**: A standardized token structure for webOS theming
* **Platform Optimization**: Values are optimized for webOS displays

## Installation

To install the package, use your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @enovaui/webos-tokens
```

or

```bash
yarn add @enovaui/webos-tokens
```

### Token Categories

* `color-semantic`: Semantic color mappings
* `radius-semantic`: Component-specific border radius values
